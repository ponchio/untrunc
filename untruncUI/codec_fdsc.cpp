/* proprietary gopro codec.
 * Contains:
 * 8	FirmwareVersion
	23	SerialNumber
	87	OtherSerialNumber
	102	Model

	always starts with GP, but I have no idea how to guess the length of the packet.
	maybe follows a pattern? 264, 152 16 16 16...

	https://github.com/stilldavid/gopro-utils can parse the gpmd codec.
