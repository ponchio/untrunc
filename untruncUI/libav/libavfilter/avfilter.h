 * inputs and outputs that are left unlinked after parsing the graph and the
 * caller then deals with them. Another difference is that in
 * avfilter_graph_parse(), the inputs parameter describes inputs of the
 * <em>already existing</em> part of the graph; i.e. from the point of view of
 * the newly created part, they are outputs. Similarly the outputs parameter
 * describes outputs of the already existing filters, which are provided as
 * inputs to the parsed filters.
 * avfilter_graph_parse2() takes the opposite approach -- it makes no reference
 * whatsoever to already existing parts of the graph and the inputs parameter
 * will on return contain inputs of the newly parsed part of the graph.
 * Analogously the outputs parameter will contain outputs of the newly created
 * filters.
