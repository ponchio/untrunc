Timecode Sample Descritpion

Reserved
A 32-bit integer that is reserved for future use. Set this field to 0.

Flags
A 32-bit integer containing flags that identify some timecode characteristics.
The following flags are defined.

Drop frame
Indicates whether the timecode is drop frame. Set it to 1 if the timecode is drop frame.
This flag’s value is 0x0001.

24 hour max
Indicates whether the timecode wraps after 24 hours. Set it to 1 if the timecode wraps.
This flag’s value is 0x0002.

Negative times OK
Indicates whether negative time values are allowed. Set it to 1 if the timecode supports negative values.
This flag’s value is 0x0004.

Counter
Indicates whether the time value corresponds to a tape counter value. Set it to 1 if the timecode values are tape counter values.
This flag’s value is 0x0008.

Time scale
A 32-bit integer that specifies the time scale for interpreting the frame duration field.

Frame duration
A 32-bit integer that indicates how long each frame lasts in real time.

Number of frames
An 8-bit integer that contains the number of frames per second for the timecode format.
If the time is a counter, this is the number of frames for each counter tick.

Reserved
An 8-bit quantity that must be set to 0.

Source reference
A user data atom containing information about the source tape. The only currently used user data list entry is the 'name' type.
This entry contains a text item specifying the name of the source tape.
